      Hi, I'm Sodiq Ardianto, a fullstack developer from Indonesia with a strong foundation in backend development using Laravel, and growing experience in frontend technologies like React and Next.js. I enjoy building scalable systems, crafting clean and maintainable code, and ensuring great user experiences. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech, refining internal tools, and learning better ways to ship and maintain software. I believe in choosing the right tools for the job and continuously improving through learning.
