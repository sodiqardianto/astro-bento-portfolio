# Building Scalable API with Laravel: Lessons Learned

Over the past three years working with Laravel on various projects, I've encountered numerous challenges when building APIs that need to handle significant traffic. Here's what I've learned about creating maintainable and scalable APIs.

## Start with Solid Foundation

When I first started, I tended to put everything in controllers. It worked for small projects, but as the codebase grew, maintenance became a nightmare. Now, I always structure my APIs with:

- **Repository Pattern** - Abstracting database operations
- **Service Layer** - Business logic separation
- **Form Request Validation** - Centralized validation rules
- **Resource Classes** - Consistent API responses

## Repository Pattern Implementation

Here's a simplified example of how I structure repositories:

```php
interface UserRepositoryInterface
{
    public function findById(int $id): ?User;
    public function create(array $data): User;
    public function update(int $id, array $data): bool;
}

class UserRepository implements UserRepositoryInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private User $model
    ) {}

    public function findById(int $id): ?User
    {
        return Cache::remember("user:{$id}", 3600, function () use ($id) {
            return $this->model->find($id);
        });
    }

    // ... implementation
}
```

## Caching Strategies

Caching is crucial for high-traffic APIs. I typically implement:

1. **Query-level caching** for frequently accessed data
2. **Response caching** using Laravel's `cache.headers` middleware
3. **Cache invalidation** on model updates using observers

## Error Handling Consistency

Nothing frustrates API consumers more than inconsistent error responses. I use a custom exception handler that formats all errors uniformly:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "email": ["The email field is required"]
  }
}
```

## Testing is Non-Negotiable

I learned this the hard way. Now every endpoint has:
- Feature tests for happy paths
- Edge case testing
- Authentication/authorization tests

Using Pest PHP has made testing much more enjoyable than PHPUnit.

## Closing Thoughts

Building scalable APIs is an iterative process. Start simple, but always keep scalability in mind. The patterns mentioned above have saved me countless hours of refactoring.

What patterns do you use in your Laravel projects? I'd love to hear your experiences.
